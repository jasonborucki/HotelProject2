            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AP8EzFq.png?1"><hr>
            <p>If customers did not make special requests, it was nearly a 50-50 split of cancellations to
            non-cancellations.</p>
            <img src="https://imgur.com/mWf6V4y.png"><hr>
            <p>However, once special requests were made, this dropped to around a 23% cancellation rate.</p>
            <img src="https://imgur.com/C63sALx.png"><hr>
            <p>A similar story can be said with car parking. If a customer did not require car parking,
            the cancellation rate was around 40%</p>
            <img src="https://imgur.com/ZAbkEBy.png"><hr>
            <p>However, with car parking, this resulted in 0 % cancellation rate across 7000 total reservations.</p>
            <img src="https://imgur.com/vziQJHn.png"><hr>
            <p>The biggest finding, however, was how far in advance reservations were made. This line linear regression
            model shows that the more in advance a reservation was made, the higher likelihood there was of a
            cancellation. For example, if the lead_time_range was a 5, this meant that a reservation was made more than
            500 days in advance. Over 600 reservations were made this far in advance and resulted in an 85%
            cancellation rate. Compare that to around a 27% cancellation rate to those reservations made within 100
            days of the date the reservation was made.</p>

            <p>The results of the model testing. 74% accuracy rate that used 50% of the data set as the training set and 50%
            for the testing set.</p><br><br><br>
